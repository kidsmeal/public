Arguments: $ARGUMENTS

The current role to backend assignments and the available external CLIs are printed above. `.gantry/models.json` is the source of truth; each role names a `backend`, and each backend names how to run it.

**Backend types**
- `native` - the in-session Claude Code subagent (the default). Hooks fire.
- `claude-headless` - a `claude -p` subprocess. Same harness, so hooks fire. Add `base_url` + `env_key` to swap in any Anthropic-compatible brain (Kimi, MiniMax, DeepSeek) while keeping the Claude Code harness.
- `cli` - a first-party external agent CLI (e.g. `codex`). Brings its own tools.
- `openai-compat` - reach any OpenAI-compatible model through Codex by selecting a provider you defined once in `~/.codex/config.toml` under `[model_providers.<name>]`.

**The one hard rule:** the **implementer** must use `native` or `claude-headless`. Those run inside the Claude Code harness, so the phase-enforcement hooks (file-list guard, commit guard) fire. `role.js` refuses any other implementer backend - it would void the hooks. Reviewers and the planner have no such restriction.

**Adversary reviewer (optional, reviewer roles only).** A reviewer role may carry an `adversary` object shaped like a role assignment (`{ "backend": ..., "model": ... }`). When configured, the orchestrator runs the adversary once on the clean diff after the primary reviewer reaches a clean verdict, and presents both verdicts at the commit gate. Example: opus as primary reviewer, codex as adversary:

```json
"phase-reviewer": {
  "backend": "native", "model": "opus",
  "adversary": { "backend": "codex", "model": "gpt-5.5" }
}
```

The `adversary` field is honored only on the two reviewer roles (`phase-reviewer`, `design-reviewer`). On `implementer` or `phase-planner` it is ignored with a warning - never an off-harness implementer by a side door. A `design-reviewer` adversary is parsed, shown by `/gantry:models`, and logged in `role.js show`, but does not fire in the orchestrator yet (reserved for v2). An adversary identical to the primary (same backend and model) is skipped with a warning at resolve time. With no `adversary` key the pipeline is byte-for-byte today's single-reviewer behavior.

**If `$ARGUMENTS` names a change** (a role plus a backend, optionally a model):
1. Ensure the config exists: run `node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/role.js" write-default` (no-op if present).
2. Read `.gantry/models.json`, set that role's `backend` (and `model` if given). If the named backend is not defined yet, add it - ask me for the missing pieces (`cmd`/`sandbox` for a `cli`, `base_url`+`env_key` for a brain-swap `claude-headless`, `provider` for `openai-compat`) rather than guessing. Examples:
   - `"codex": { "type": "cli", "cmd": "codex exec --model {model} --sandbox {sandbox} --skip-git-repo-check", "promptVia": "stdin", "sandbox": "workspace-write" }`
   - `"kimi": { "type": "claude-headless", "base_url": "https://api.moonshot.ai/anthropic", "env_key": "MOONSHOT_API_KEY" }` (implementer-eligible)
   - `"deepseek": { "type": "openai-compat", "provider": "deepseek", "sandbox": "workspace-write" }`
3. Re-run `node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/role.js" show` and relay the result. If it reports an ERROR for any role (e.g. an implementer routed off-harness), the change is invalid - revert that role and tell me why.
4. If the chosen backend needs an API key (`env_key`), remind me to export it; if it is a `cli`/`openai-compat`, remind me the CLI must be installed and authed (`codex login`).

**If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty**, just explain the current setup shown above and how to change it. Do not edit anything.

Never route the implementer off the Claude Code harness. Never invent a backend's connection details.
